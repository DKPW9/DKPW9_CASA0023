# Case study

### Cooling Singapore 2.0 – Digital Urban Climate Twin (DUCT)

.pull-left[
- Aims to simulate scenarios in regions experiencing elevated temperatures, which may involve the incorporation of additional parks and open spaces.
- Recently, a beta version of DUCT was released for testing by urban planners and policy makers.
- Integrates all pertinent computational models to consider environmental variables such as wind and sunlight, land cover, traffic, industrial and building energy models, and human mobility + allows for the simulation of various scenarios.
- *"When developed, the digital tool will help us make more informed decisions when implementing different mitigation strategies to improve outdoor thermal comfort at the nationwide level.”* (URA, 2023)
- Target is to achieve Technology Readiness Level 6+ by August 2024.
