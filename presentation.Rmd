(i) Medellin’s implemented Corredor Verde 
- Missed opportunities for continuous monitoring using remote sensing data
- Failed to fully utilise traffic congestion data
- Limited socio-demographic analysis
- Overlooked the urban heat island effect


(ii) Bogotá’s Septima Verde: a rejected proposal
- Rejected due to skepticism of sustainability claims 
- Lack of EO data demonstrating environmental benefits
- No predictive modelling to anticipate traffic impacts
