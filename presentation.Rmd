## Bogota: the context 

.pull-left[Once celebrated for the world’s longest cycle route and the innovative Transmilenio system, Bogotá now faces several key challenges, including:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= "100%", fig.show='hold', fig.align= 'left'}

knitr::include_graphics('bogota.png')
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= "65%", fig.show='hold', fig.align= 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics('context.png')
```
]

## Past interventions
.pull-left[
```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='left', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("map.png")
```
]

.pull-right[ 
##### (i) Medellin’s implemented Corredor Verde 
- Missed opportunities for continuous monitoring using remote sensing data
- Failed to fully utilise traffic congestion data
- Limited socio-demographic analysis
- Overlooked the urban heat island effect

##### (ii) Bogotá’s rejected Septima Verde
- Rejected due to skepticism of sustainability claims 
- Lack of EO data demonstrating environmental benefits
- No predictive modelling to anticipate traffic impacts

## International and national compliance

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= "90%", fig.show='hold', fig.align= 'centre'}

## Proposal

#### Main Objective:
- Develop a simulator using land surface temperature data and traffic data to identify optimal locations for a green corridor in Bogota.
- Account for how this will affect city-wide traffic flow and heat patterns before implementation.

#### Secondary Objectives:
- Transform key streets and corridors to prioritize greenery, public spaces, and pedestrian access. 
- Improve air quality by decreasing traffic congestion.

#### Outputs:
- A comprehensive simulator tool for planning green corridors.
- Capacity building programs for stakeholders to leverage the simulator in urban planning.
- A detailed proposal for the green corridor's location and design based on simulator outcomes.

## Integration to Bogota's pipeline

.pull-left[ 

### Data integration: baseline and recollection for simulator

- **Environmental Monitoring Systems:** Align temperature data with SINA standards and implement automated APIs.
- **Traffic Data Integration:** Work with SIMUR to integrate real-time traffic data.

### During the creation of the simulator and its respective capacity building

- **Urban Planning Software Compatibility:** Ensure simulator outputs are compatible with Bogotá's POT.
- **Training and Capacity Building:** Develop training for city staff on integrating simulator data.

]

.pull-right[ 

### Collaborative decision making for choosing the site

- **Integration into Strategic Planning Sessions:** Include simulator insights in planning sessions.
- **Policy Impact Assessments:** Use simulator data for impact assessments of urban projects.

### External communication and public engagement

- **Digital Engagement Platforms:** Use "Bogotá Abierta" to share findings and gather feedback.
- **Community Workshops and Forums:** Organize workshops with JACs in high-impact neighborhoods.

## Limitations and mitigation of risk

## Future continuation
- Retain use of the mapping tool for future green space implementations or road traffic adjustments
- Trained team of geo data analysts for tool implementation and future development
- Future iterations could predict other factors such as air quality by incorporating more data on building and vegetation height, meteorological data on wind speed and direction, and air quality recordings.
