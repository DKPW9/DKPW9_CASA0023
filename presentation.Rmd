# Bogota: the context 

.pull-left[Once celebrated for the world’s longest cycle route and the innovative Transmilenio system, Bogotá now faces several key challenges, including:

(i) Medellin’s implemented Corredor Verde 
- Missed opportunities for continuous monitoring using remote sensing data
- Failed to fully utilise traffic congestion data
- Limited socio-demographic analysis
- Overlooked the urban heat island effect


(ii) Bogotá’s Septima Verde: a rejected proposal
- Rejected due to skepticism of sustainability claims 
- Lack of EO data demonstrating environmental benefits
- No predictive modelling to anticipate traffic impacts
- Insufficient stakeholder engagement

### Cooling Singapore 2.0 – Digital Urban Climate Twin (DUCT)

.pull-left[
<small>
- Aims to simulate scenarios in regions experiencing elevated temperatures, which may involve the incorporation of additional parks and open spaces.
- A beta version of DUCT was released for testing by urban planners and policy makers.
- Integrates all pertinent computational models to consider environmental variables such as wind and sunlight, land cover, traffic, industrial and building energy models, and human mobility + allows for the simulation of various scenarios.
- Target is to achieve Technology Readiness Level 6+ by August 2024.
