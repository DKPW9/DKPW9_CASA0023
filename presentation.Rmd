## Past interventions
```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width='45%', fig.align='left', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("map.png")
```

---
## International and national compliance

---
## Case study

OFFER A LOGICAL workflow that incorporates EO data (at least one dataset required)

---
## Workflow: simulation

DISCUSS HOW DATA + WORKFLOW CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO THE CITY'S 'BUSINESS AS USUAL' DATA PIPELINES/WORKFLOWS

---
## Workflow: site selection

PROPOSE TIMELINE FOR PLAN

## Integration to Bogota's pipeline

.pull-left[
### Data integration: baseline and recollection for simulator

- Environmental Monitoring Systems: Align temperature data with SINA standards and implement automated APIs.
- Traffic Data Integration: Work with SIMUR to integrate real-time traffic data.

### During the creation of the simulator and its respective capacity building

- Urban Planning Software Compatibility: Ensure simulator outputs are compatible with Bogotá's POT.
- Training and Capacity Building: Develop training for city staff on integrating simulator data.

.pull-right[
### Collaborative decision making for choosing the site

- Integration into Strategic Planning Sessions: Include simulator insights in planning sessions.
- Policy Impact Assessments: Use simulator data for impact assessments of urban projects.

### External communication and public engagement

- Digital Engagement Platforms: Use "Bogotá Abierta" to share findings and gather feedback.
- Community Workshops and Forums: Organize workshops with JACs in high-impact neighborhoods.

## Team Roles and Purposes

| Team                    | Role/Purpose                                                                                                            |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project coordinator     | Oversee all project activities, ensuring milestones are met and align with the project's objectives and stakeholder expectations. |
| Admin                   | Provide logistical, administrative, and operational support to ensure smooth project execution.                         |
| Remote sensing specialist | Expertise in acquiring and processing high-resolution optical imagery, NDVI, thermal infrared imagery, and air quality sensor data. Skilled in the use of software for satellite image classification, such as SVM (Support Vector Machines). |
| GIS analyst             | Proficient in GIS software to integrate various data layers, perform spatial analysis, and produce maps and visualizations. Experience with land cover classification and regression analysis to assess relationships between land cover changes and temperature (LST data). |
| Transportation engineer | Skilled in transport modeling and simulation, ideally with experience using SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) or similar tools. Able to import and adjust road network data from sources like OpenStreetMap and calibrate models to reflect real-world conditions. |
| Data scientist          | Capable of managing and analyzing large datasets, including journey origin-destination matrices and traffic flow data. Competent in statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization. |
| Software developer      | To support the integration of simulation tools with GIS software, database systems, and potentially develop custom solutions for data analysis and visualization. |
