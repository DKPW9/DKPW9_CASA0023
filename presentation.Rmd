## Integration to Bogota's pipeline

.pull-left[
### Data integration: baseline and recollection for simulator

- Environmental Monitoring Systems: Align temperature data with SINA standards and implement automated APIs.
- Traffic Data Integration: Work with SIMUR to integrate real-time traffic data.

### During the creation of the simulator and its respective capacity building

- Urban Planning Software Compatibility: Ensure simulator outputs are compatible with Bogotá's POT.
- Training and Capacity Building: Develop training for city staff on integrating simulator data.
]

.pull-right[
### Collaborative decision making for choosing the site

- Integration into Strategic Planning Sessions: Include simulator insights in planning sessions.
- Policy Impact Assessments: Use simulator data for impact assessments of urban projects.

### External communication and public engagement

- Digital Engagement Platforms: Use "Bogotá Abierta" to share findings and gather feedback.
- Community Workshops and Forums: Organize workshops with JACs in high-impact neighborhoods.
